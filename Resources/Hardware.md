## Additional Hacking Hardware

- **[WiFi Pineapple](https://hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple):** A Hak5 tool used to audit wireless networks, intercept traffic, and perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on Wi-Fi environments.
  
- **[LAN Turtle](https://hak5.org/products/lan-turtle):** A covert network penetration tool that can be used to tap into networks for data exfiltration, man-in-the-middle attacks, and persistent backdoor access.

- **[USB Rubber Ducky](https://hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky):** A USB device designed to exploit systems by emulating a keyboard to quickly inject payloads for system compromise or network attacks.

- **[Proxmark3](https://proxmark.com/):** A powerful tool for RFID and NFC security research, allowing for reading, writing, and cloning RFID tags and cards.

- **[Alfa AWUS036ACH](https://www.alfa.com.tw/products/alfa-awus036ach):** A USB WiFi adapter widely used in wireless security testing due to its high-gain antennas and compatibility with Kali Linux and other pentesting tools.

- **[HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/):** A versatile software-defined radio (SDR) device that allows for wireless communication analysis, signal manipulation, and frequency spectrum hacking.

- **[Bash Bunny](https://hak5.org/products/bash-bunny):** A multi-function pentest tool for automating attacks through USB. Itâ€™s designed for fast payload execution and allows for network attacks, keystroke injection, and data extraction.
